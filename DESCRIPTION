Description: An implementation of module detection procedure in network based on Topological
	Overlap Matrix (TOM), which in addition incorporates with numeric attribute of vertices
	(represented as vertex heat) by assigning edge weight as the heat similarity of linked
	vertices. Heat diffusion (random walk) is implemented to smoothen heat difference of
	neighboring vertices to reduce noise. The method was initially designed to analyze human
	protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to identify functional modules which are related
	to neuron maturation. Heat of each vertex was represented as its expression level difference
	between mature and immature neurons.
